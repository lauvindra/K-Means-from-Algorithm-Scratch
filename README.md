# K-Means-Means-from-Scratch
# 1. Introduction
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data. This is an algorithm that tries to minimize the distance of the points in a cluster with their centroid. Groups are known as cluster and the processs of creating the groups are known as clustering. Clustering is the process of dividing the entiire data into groups based on the pattern of the data.

# 2. Objective

* Group similar data points together and discover underlying patterns.
* K means algorithm identifies k number of centroids and allocates every data point to the nearest cluster.

# 3. K-Means Algorithm
